## Integration in Analysis

### Initial Analysis Phase
1. Started with Problems and Growling datasets due to:
   - Higher complexity (10 and 9 variables)
   - More nuanced response patterns
   - Better discriminatory power
   - Complementary behavioral aspects

2. These datasets revealed:
   - Two distinct behavioral clusters
   - Clear separation between reactive and typical dogs
   - Strong human-directed reaction patterns
   - Complex behavioral interactions

### Comprehensive Analysis Phase
1. Added Howling and Keeping datasets to:
   - Validate initial findings
   - Add environmental context
   - Understand trigger patterns
   - Provide complete behavioral picture

2. Full dataset integration showed:
   - Consistent cluster structure
   - Additional supporting evidence
   - Environmental influences
   - Broader behavioral context

## Conclusions

The multi-dataset approach provided:
1. Strong primary clustering based on complex behaviors
2. Supporting evidence from simpler datasets
3. Environmental and contextual understanding
4. Comprehensive behavioral profiles
5. Robust and validated findings

This approach maximized the value of each dataset while acknowledging their different contributions to the overall analysis. The combination of all datasets provided a more complete and nuanced understanding of dog behavioral patterns than any single dataset could provide alone.
