# Final Analysis Summary: Dog Behavioral Patterns

## Dataset Analysis Rationale

### 1. Data Structure and Quality
- **Problems Dataset** (10 variables):
  * Most complex behavioral patterns
  * 16.65% response rate
  * Average 1.66 behaviors per dog
  * High discriminatory power

- **Growling Dataset** (9 variables):
  * Second most complex patterns
  * 15.13% response rate
  * Average 1.36 targets per dog
  * Good discriminatory power

- **Howling Dataset** (4 variables):
  * Limited variables
  * 25.93% response rate
  * Average 1.04 responses
  * Low discriminatory power

- **Keeping Dataset** (5 variables):
  * Limited variables
  * 24.42% response rate
  * Average 1.22 responses
  * Dominated by indoor keeping

### 2. Clustering Effectiveness
Silhouette scores for different cluster numbers:
- 2 clusters: 0.360 (optimal)
- 3 clusters: 0.296
- 4 clusters: 0.285
- 5 clusters: 0.156
- 6 clusters: 0.165

### 3. Final Cluster Characteristics

#### Cluster 1: "High Reactivity Group" (519 dogs, 9.3%)
Primary characteristics:
1. Indoor living (92.7%)
2. High reactivity to adult men (91.1%)
3. Sensitivity to unusual movements (71.1%)
4. Dog-dog reactivity (64.7%)
5. Sensitivity to bearded men (59.3%)

Behavioral Pattern:
- Shows consistent heightened reactivity
- Multiple human-related triggers
- Complex behavioral responses
- Likely requires specialized management

#### Cluster 2: "Typical Behavior Group" (5068 dogs, 90.7%)
Primary characteristics:
1. Indoor living (91.8%)
2. Moderate dog-dog reactivity (37.0%)
3. Garden access (26.8%)
4. Noise sensitivity (26.8%)
5. Jumping behavior (20.4%)

Behavioral Pattern:
- Generally lower reactivity levels
- More common behavioral traits
- Less specific trigger patterns
- Manageable with standard training

## Implications for Analysis Approach

1. **Dataset Selection Rationale**
   - Initial focus on Problems and Growling datasets was justified by:
     * Higher behavioral complexity
     * More nuanced response patterns
     * Better discriminatory power
     * More meaningful for clustering

2. **Validation Through Comprehensive Analysis**
   - Combined analysis confirmed:
     * Optimal cluster number (2)
     * Similar cluster sizes
     * Consistent behavioral patterns
     * Robust clustering solution

3. **Behavioral Pattern Consistency**
   - Patterns remained stable across:
     * Individual dataset analysis
     * Combined dataset analysis
     * Different clustering approaches

## Recommendations

1. **For Research**
   - Focus on high-discriminatory variables
   - Consider weighted analysis for complex behaviors
   - Investigate temporal stability of clusters
   - Study intervention effectiveness by cluster

2. **For Practice**
   - Develop cluster-specific management strategies
   - Focus on trigger pattern recognition
   - Implement targeted training programs
   - Consider environmental management

3. **For Future Data Collection**
   - Expand behavioral variables where needed
   - Include temporal aspects of behavior
   - Consider intensity measures
   - Track intervention outcomes
