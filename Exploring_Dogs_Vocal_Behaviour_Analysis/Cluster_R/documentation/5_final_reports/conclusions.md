- Environmental impact studies

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis has revealed a clear two-cluster structure in dog behavioral patterns, validated through multiple analytical approaches and datasets. The independence of different behavioral aspects, combined with their hierarchical organization, suggests the need for comprehensive assessment and tailored intervention approaches. The findings provide a strong foundation for both practical applications in dog training and future research directions in canine behavior.
